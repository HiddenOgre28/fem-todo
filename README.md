## My process
You can read all about it in my [latest blog post!](#) (Coming Soon!)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Learned to share state down from a parent to its children the easy way with the useContext hook.
- Learned to manage more complex state with the useReducer hook.
- Learned to make themes with Sass and implement them in React.


### Continued development

After this, I will be finishing the REST Countries API challenge from Frontend Mentor, while getting started with the three.js library.
